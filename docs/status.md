# WOPR Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Infrastructure

---

**Things I'd like now that I've had time to process things**
- on wopr_config - needs a UI that can edit the thing like yaml.
- local config cache, cache invalidation, config versioning in the DB, auto config rollback if a problem detected, problem detection. 
- status page
- telemetry 
- add telemetry to config and core module
- centralize the core module
- installer
- be able to rollout services via installer

## 🎯 Current Focus

**20251214 - 2025, Dec 14**
**What I'm actively working on right now:**
- [ ] Setting up config service in k8s cluster
- [X] rpi + webcam (Bus 001 Device 003: ID 328f:00ec EMEET EMEET SmartCam C960 4K)
- [X] have a python script to caputre the images using the wopr-config python module.
- [X] writing a service to run on woprcam (the pi) and take the image.
- [X] Decision: naming convention, so wopr-config_service not wopr-config-service, because the thing is "config_service" and wopr is the "app" or "env" or whatever. - seperates major things, _ is spaces in names in names of services or apps, so app-service_name.
- [ ] want to see how to integrate a proper project mangement system easily into claude and my github so I can use 1 ui for code and pm tracking, and claude is updated.  Or if I can just do diffs like this, where I update this section, and paste it into claude, that'd work, but I'd like him to at least see my code and keep updated of what's going on. Do this:
```
git commit -m "feat: wopr-cam_service flask endpoint"

# Update STATUS.md
# Add commit message to "Recently Completed"

# When chatting with Claude
git log --oneline -10 > recent_work.txt
# Paste STATUS.md + recent_work.txt
```

**Where to pick up:**
- Get wopr_config in k8s
- python module distribution
- 

**Time estimate to complete current tasks:**

## 🚧 Blockers / Issues

**Active blockers:**
- None currently

**Questions/Decisions needed:**
- Should wopr-vision and wopr-adjudicator be separate services or combined?
- 

**Waiting on:**
- Hardware: RPi Camera Module 3 (ETA: )
- 

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Deploy config service to k8s
2. Set up PostgreSQL (wopr-db)
3. Configure NFS mounts on k8s nodes
4. Build wopr-cam service skeleton
5.

  - [x] wopr-config-db (PostgreSQL)
  
- **K8s Cluster (studio):**
  - [ ] Nothing deployed yet
  
- **Raspberry Pi:**
  - [ ] Not set up yet
  
- **Desktop (Ollama):**
  - [ ] Not configured yet

## 📝 Technical Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-12-14 | Use database-backed config service | Dynamic updates without redeployment |
| 2025-12-14 | Celery for async processing | Vision analysis takes 30-60s, can't block API |
| 2025-12-14 | FastAPI for wopr-api | Modern, async-capable, good docs |
| | | |

## 🐛 Known Issues

- None yet

## 💡 Ideas / Future Enhancements

- Consider WebSocket for real-time UI updates instead of polling
- Look into persistent volume claims for PostgreSQL HA

## 🆘 Help Needed From Claude

**Next time we chat, I need help with:**
1. Deploying config service to k8s (ArgoCD vs kubectl)
2. Database schema design for wopr_main
3. 

**Questions to ask:**
- 
- 

---

## 🎓 Things I Learned

- Database-backed config is way more flexible than files
- Celery isn't as scary as it sounds
-
